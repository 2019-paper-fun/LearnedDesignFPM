# Data-Driven Design for Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy

This library provides an implementation of physics-based learned design for Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM).

FPM reconstructions implemented in Pytorch and learning is accomplished using backpropagation. All is fully supported to run on GPU.

Datasets are provided at ...
