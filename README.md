# Data-Driven Design for Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy

This library provides an implementation of physics-based learned design for Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM). Reconstructions are implemented in Pytorch, learning is accomplished using backpropagation, and all is fully supported to run on GPU.

Simulated datasets and experimental data is [here]().
